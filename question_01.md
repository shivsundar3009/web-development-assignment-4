Hoisting in JavaScript is a concept that refers to how variable and function declarations are handled during the JavaScript runtime's creation phase. It allows you to use variables and functions before they are declared in your code.

During the creation phase, JavaScript moves variable and function declarations to the top of their respective scopes. This means that regardless of where you declare a variable or function in your code, JavaScript effectively "hoists" it to the top of its containing scope.

However, it's important to note that hoisting only moves the declarations, not the initializations or assignments. Variables and functions are hoisted in separate ways:

01. Variable Hoisting:

    Variable declarations (using 'var') are hoisted to the top of their scope and are automatically initialized with a value of 'undefined'.

    Example: 
    `
    console.log(myVariable); // undefined
    var myVariable = 42;
    `

    The above code is effectively interpreted as:
    `
    var myVariable; // declaration is hoisted
    console.log(myVariable); // undefined
    myVariable = 42; // assignment remains in place
    `

02. Function Hoisting:

    Function declarations are hoisted in their entirety, meaning both the function name and its body are moved to the top of their scope. Therefore, you can call the function before its actual declaration in the code.

    Example:
    `
    myFunction(); // "Hello, hoisting!"
    function myFunction() {
    console.log("Hello, hoisting!");}
    `

    The above code is effectively interpreted as:
    `
    function myFunction() {
    console.log("Hello, hoisting!");}
    myFunction(); // "Hello, hoisting!"
    `

It's worth mentioning that hoisting does not apply to variables declared with 'let' and 'const'. They are also hoisted to the top of their block scope but are not initialized automatically. If you try to access them before their declaration, you will encounter a 'ReferenceError'. This behavior is known as the "temporal dead zone."

To write clean and maintainable code, it's recommended to declare your variables and functions at the beginning of their scope explicitly, even though JavaScript hoists them. This helps in avoiding any confusion and potential bugs caused by relying on hoisting.
