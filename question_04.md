ECMAScript 6, also known as ECMAScript 2015 or ES6, introduced several major features and improvements to the JavaScript language. Here are some of the key features introduced in ES6:

01. Arrow Functions: Arrow functions provide a more concise syntax for writing function expressions. They have a lexical 'this' binding and don't create their own 'this', making them useful for maintaining the scope of 'this' in nested functions.

02. Block-Scoped Variables: The 'let' and 'const' keywords were introduced for declaring block-scoped variables. They have a more predictable behavior compared to 'var' when it comes to scoping and hoisting.

03. Classes: ES6 introduced the 'class' syntax, providing a more convenient and familiar syntax for defining classes and creating objects using the class-based inheritance model. It simplifies the creation of objects with constructors, methods, and inheritance.

04. Modules: ES6 introduced a standardized module syntax with the 'import' and 'export' keywords. Modules allow you to organize and separate code into reusable and maintainable components, making it easier to manage dependencies.

05. Template Literals: Template literals provide an improved way to concatenate strings and embed expressions within backticks (`) instead of single or double quotes. They support multi-line strings and allow for easy interpolation of variables or expressions using `${}`.

06. Destructuring Assignment: Destructuring assignment enables extracting values from arrays or objects into individual variables using a concise syntax. It simplifies the process of working with complex data structures and can improve code readability.

07. Spread and Rest Operators: The spread (...) operator allows for the expansion of arrays or objects into individual elements or properties, respectively. The rest (...) operator is used to gather multiple elements or properties into an array or object. These operators provide a more flexible way to work with collections of data.

08. Promises: Promises are a built-in mechanism for handling asynchronous operations. They provide an alternative to callback-based approaches and allow for more readable and manageable asynchronous code flow.

09. Default Parameters: ES6 introduced the ability to set default values for function parameters. If an argument is not provided when calling the function, the default value is used instead. 'this' simplifies the handling of optional or missing function arguments.

10. Enhanced Object Literals: Object literals gained several enhancements in ES6, including shorthand property and method definitions, computed property names, and the ability to define getters and setters within object literals.

These are just some of the major features introduced in ECMAScript 6. ES6 brought significant improvements to JavaScript, making the language more expressive, concise, and powerful, and many of these features have become widely adopted in modern JavaScript development.
