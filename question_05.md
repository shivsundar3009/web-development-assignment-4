In many programming languages, including JavaScript, `let` and `const` are used to declare variables. Here are the main differences between them:

01. Mutability: Variables declared with `let` are mutable, meaning their values can be changed. On the other hand, variables declared with `const` are immutable, and their values cannot be reassigned once they are defined.

   ```
   let x = 5;
   x = 10; // Valid: x can be reassigned
   console.log(x); // Output: 10

   const y = 15;
   y = 20; // Invalid: y cannot be reassigned
   console.log(y); // Output: 15
   ```

02. Scope: Both `let` and `const` have block scope, meaning they are only accessible within the block in which they are defined. However, variables declared with `let` can be reassigned within the same scope, while variables declared with `const` cannot be reassigned.

   ```
   if (true) {
     let a = 5;
     const b = 10;
     a = 15; // Valid: a can be reassigned within the same block
     b = 20; // Invalid: b cannot be reassigned within the same block
   }

   console.log(a); // Error: 'a' is not defined
   console.log(b); // Error: 'b' is not defined
   ```

03. Hoisting: Both `let` and `const` are block-scoped and not hoisted to the top of their scope like variables declared with `var`. This means that variables declared with `let` and `const` are not accessible before their declaration within the block.

   ```
   console.log(x); // Error: 'x' is not defined
   console.log(y); // Error: 'y' is not defined

   let x = 5;
   const y = 10;
   ```

04. Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ): Variables declared with `let` and `const` are subject to TDZ, which means that if you try to access them before they are declared, you will get a `ReferenceError`. This helps catch potential issues caused by accessing variables before they are assigned.

   ```
   console.log(x); // Error: Cannot access 'x' before initialization

   let x = 5;
   ```

It's generally recommended to use `const` when you don't intend to reassign a variable, as it promotes immutability and can help prevent accidental modifications. Use `let` when you need to declare a variable that might change its value in the future.
